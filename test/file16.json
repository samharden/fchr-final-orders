Recommended Order of Dismissal, \u00b6 4.The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 states, 'Any person aggrieved by a violation of [the Act] may file a complaint with the commission within 365 days of the alleged violation...'  Section 760.11(1), Florida Statutes (1999).We note that while the Charge of Discrimination transmitted to the Division of Administrative Hearings in this case does reflect that Petitioner signed the complaint on April 1, 1996 (indicating a date of discrimination of May 10, 1995), the Charge of Discrimination does contain a Commission date stamp of June 26, 1996.  See Filing.  Nevertheless, the Commission\u2019s Individual Complaint Log in this matter reflects a filing date of April 1, 1996.Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s finding that, 'Petitioner\u2019s complaint was untimely' (Recommended Order of Dismissal, \u00b6 4), is not supported by competent substantial evidence, and find that the record reflects that the complaint in this matter was timely filed.  Accord, Jackson v. Halifax Medical Center, FCHR Order No. 00-022.The Administrative Law Judge also concluded that the Petition for Relief from an Unlawful Employment Practice was not filed within 35 days of the date of the no reasonable cause 'determination' in this matter and, therefore, was not timely filed.  Recommended Order of Dismissal, \u00b6 5 through \u00b6 8.The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 (Act) states, 'If the commission determines that there is not reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the [Act] has occurred, the commission shall dismiss the complaint.  The aggrieved person may request an administrative hearing..., but any such request must be made within 35 days of the date of determination of reasonable cause...  If the aggrieved person does not request an administrative hearing within the 35 days, the claim will be barred.'  Section 760.11(7), Florida Statutes (1999).        We note that along with the Petition for Relief from an Unlawful Employment Practice, Petitioner filed a notarized statement in Spanish, explaining why the Petition was filed late.  A translation of the statement by Commission personnel reflects that Petitioner indicates that post office personnel placed the Notice of Dismissal and Petition for Relief form in the wrong mailbox and Petitioner did not receive these items until the people who received this mail by mistake gave it to Petitioner.  See Filing.We conclude this to be 'excusable neglect' for the late-filing (although it is difficult to see how this can be determined to be 'neglect' of any type on the part of Petitioner), and find the Petition for Relief to be timely filed.Finally, we find: (1) that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion of law we are correcting is within the substantive jurisdiction of the Florida Commission on Human Relations, namely the interpretation of the time period for filing a request for administrative relief under the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; (2) the reason the correction is being made is that the conclusion of law as stated by the Administrative Law Judge does not consider the statement provided by Petitioner and its impact on whether the 'late-filing' of the Petition was excusable; and (3) that in making this correction the conclusion of law we are substituting is as or more reasonable than the conclusion which has been rejected.

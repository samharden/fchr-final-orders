Mere speculation as to the cause of the termination is insufficient to make out a prima facie case of discrimination. More importantly, there was no evidence that she was replaced by a person outside the protected group.'  Recommended Order, \u00b6 19.We hold that the Administrative Law Judge committed error of law in concluding that Petitioner failed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.In a case involving allegations of age discrimination, a Commission panel has indicated, 'To establish a prima facie case of discrimination in situations where individuals have lost           their positions, it has been stated that a Petitioner must show, \u2018(1) that he belongs to a group protected by the statute; (2) that he was qualified for the job; (3) that he was terminated; and (4) that after his termination, the employer hired a person not in [P]etitioner\u2019s protected class or retained those having comparable or lessor qualifications, not in the protected class.\u2019 Arnold v. Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 16 F.A.L.R. 576, at 582 (FCHR 1993).' Green v. ATC/VANCOM Management, Inc., 20 F.A.L.R. 314, at 315 (FCHR 1997).We note that the Administrative Law Judge found that, 'It is clear that Mrs. McGill is a member of a protected class based upon her age and that she is qualified to accomplish her job as a cook or as a kitchen manager.  Moreover, it is clear that she was subjected to an adverse employment action in that she was terminated.'  Recommended Order, \u00b6 18.  Further, the Administrative Law Judge found that Respondent\u2019s general manager remarked that '...Mrs. McGill was the oldest person in the kitchen...,' suggesting that Respondent retained those having comparable qualifications to Mrs. McGill, not in the protected class. Recommended Order, \u00b6 5.Applying the test for establishing a prima facie case set out in Green, supra, to the facts found by the Administrative Law Judge set out above, we conclude that Petitioner established a prima facie case of age discrimination.It has been stated that if the '...burden [of establishing a prima facie case] is sustained, the Respondent must articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action.  Hart v. Double Envelope Corporation, 15 F.A.L.R. 1664, at 1673 (FCHR 1992).'  O\u2019Neill v. Sarasota County School Board, 18 F.A.L.R. 1129, at 1130 (1994).  It has also been stated that once evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination has been introduced, '[t]he defendant then knows that its failure to introduce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason will cause judgment to go against it unless the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case is held to be inadequate in law or fails to            convince the factfinder.'  St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, 113 S. Ct. 2742, at 2749 f.n. 3 (1993).Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s establishment of a prima facie case of discrimination, as explained above, coupled with Respondent\u2019s failure to appear at the formal hearing of this matter (see, Recommended Order, Appearances section and Preliminary Statement section), results in the ultimate conclusion that Respondent committed an unlawful employment practice on the basis of Petitioner\u2019s age when it terminated Petitioner from her position.We also note that the Administrative Law Judge seems to suggest that as an element of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination a causal connection must be shown between the act complained of and the protected class of age. See, Recommended Order, \u00b6 19.However, the Commission has indicated that this element is actually what a Petitioner is attempting to show by establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, and that this should not, itself, be an element of the test for a prima facie case.  See, Baxla v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Fleetwood Homes of Florida, Inc., 20 F.A.L.R. 2583, at 2585 (FCHR 1998), citing Pugh v. Walt Disney World, 18 F.A.L.R. 1971, at 1972 (FCHR 1995), and Martinez v. Orange County Fleet Manager, 21 F.A.L.R. 163, at 164 (FCHR 1997).Finally, the Administrative Law Judge concluded that to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 'Petitioner must show that she was over 40 years of age at time of her discharge.'  Recommended Order, \u00b6 17.We clarify that a Commission panel has concluded, 'While the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act uses the age of 40 as the age at which the Act\u2019s protection begins (see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631), the age of 40 has no significance in interpreting the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992, or its predecessor, the Human Rights Act of 1977, as amended.  The Commission has consistently held that Florida law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of any age, birth to death...'  Green, supra, at 315.In modifying the conclusions of law of the Administrative Law Judge as explained, supra, we find:  (1) that the conclusions of law being modified are conclusions of law over which the Commission has substantive jurisdiction, namely conclusions of law stating what must be demonstrated to establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination under the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; (2) that the reason the modifications are being made by the Commission is that the conclusions of law as applied run contrary to previous Commission decisions on the issue; and (3) that in making these modifications the conclusions of law we are substituting are as or more reasonable than the conclusions of law which have been rejected. See, Section 120.57(1)(l), Florida Statutes (1999).

Recommended Order, \u00b6 20.While we recognize that compensation for mental anguish could have been awarded by a court had Petitioner filed a civil action following the issuance of the Executive Director\u2019s 'cause' determination in this matter (See, Sections 509.092 and 760.11(4) and (5),Florida Statutes (1999)), we conclude there is no statutory authority for the Commission to award compensation for metal anguish in situations such as this where Petitioner has sought relief through administrative hearing.  See, Sections 509.092 and 760.11(4) and (6), Florida Statutes (1999).In correcting this conclusion of law we find: (1) that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion of law we are correcting is within the substantive jurisdiction of the Florida Commission on Human Relations, namely the interpretation of the 'relief' provisions of the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; (2) the reason the correction is being made is that the conclusion of law as stated by the Administrative Law Judge is not supported in law; and (3) that in making this correction the rejection of the conclusion of law in question is as or more reasonable than allowing the incorrect conclusion of law to remain.  See, Section 120.57(1)(l), Florida Statutes (1999).With the above-indicated correction, we adopt the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusions of law.

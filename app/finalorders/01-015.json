Specifically, the Administrative Law Judge stated, 'The Division of Administrative Hearings has no jurisdiction to hear allegations of discriminatory conduct which FCHR has not investigated or made a determination as to reasonable cause.'  Recommended Order of Dismissal,\u00b6 19.The Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992 does allow Petitioners to file a request for administrative hearing in situations where 180 days have passed since the filing of the complaint and the Commission has not yet reached a determination as to reasonable cause, and, therefore, in those instances, the Division of Administrative Hearings would have jurisdiction to hear allegations of discriminatory conduct 'which FCHR has not investigated or made a determination as to reasonable cause.' See, Sections 760.11(8) and 760.11(4), Florida Statutes (1999).We, therefore, correct/clarify this conclusion of law.In so doing we find: (1) that the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion of law we are correcting is within the substantive jurisdiction of the Florida Commission on Human Relations, namely the interpretation of in what instances a Petitioner is entitled to an administrative hearing under the Florida Civil Rights Act of 1992; (2) the reason the correction is being made is that the conclusion of law as stated by the Administrative Law Judge is not supported in law; and (3) that in making this correction the rejection of the conclusion of law in question is as or more reasonable than allowing the incorrect conclusion of law to remain.  See, Section 120.57(1)(l), Florida Statutes (1999).With the above-stated correction/clarification, we adopt the Administrative Law Judge's conclusions of law."], "heading_4": "Exceptions", "heading_4_text": ["Neither party filed exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's recommended order."], "heading_5": "Dismissal", "heading_5_text": "Hm"}, "result": {"description": "Dismissed with Prejudice"}, "title": {"description": "FINAL ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR\n                   RELIEF FROM AN UNLAWFUL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE"}}
